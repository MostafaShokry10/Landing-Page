This project has the scope of converting a static web page in a single interactive page.

It uses javascript to dynamically create navigation Sectiond & bar links based on the content, when a section appear in the viewport it show the active state of that section.


after 4 seconds of not scrolling, the navbar is automatically hidden and showed when scrolling.
